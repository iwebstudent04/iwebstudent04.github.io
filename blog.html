                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">7/5/19</div>
                <p>This week I explored adobe XD and created a circle artboard that took forever. I also learned how to
                    make an image appear in my websites. I created different artboards for each season.

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">6/28/19</div>
                <p>This week I explored photoshop and Illistrator. I learned that vector is for Illistrator and its a
                    bunch of dots.
                    I learned that raster is for photoshop and that rastor is a bunch of pixels. This week I also
                    explored Adobe XD.
                    I learned about prototype mode on Adobe XD, and that it could link pages together. I also used XD to
                    design possible designs
                    for my website.

                <div class="date">6/21/19</div>
                <p>This week in class I deleted all of my old styling {CSS}, and I started putting in essintial CSS and
                    HTML.
                    For example, the Header and the Footer. I also created 3 lists on my home page. I added 2 sub pages
                    the blog page and the about page. I customized my website by adding pictures and colors. I blurred
                    my blog and about photos.</p>
